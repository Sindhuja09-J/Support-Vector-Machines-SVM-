# üß† SVM Binary Classification with Visualization

This project demonstrates how to perform binary classification using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with both **linear** and **RBF kernels**. It includes visualization of decision boundaries, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and performance evaluation using cross-validation.


## ‚úÖ What This Project Covers

- Creating a 2D binary classification dataset.
- Training two SVM classifiers: one with a **linear kernel**, one with an **RBF (non-linear) kernel**.
- Visualizing decision boundaries using `matplotlib`.
- Tuning SVM hyperparameters (`C` and `gamma`) using `GridSearchCV`.
- Evaluating model performance with **cross-validation** and a **classification report**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
